# SavingTerraGame

Weâ€™re designing a game with a space based theme that reflect our interest to astronomy. 

Terra in our project title stands for the Latin word of 'Earth' and we choose this name to make people curious and interested by our game ,we were inspired by the famous game 'Ant's smasher' ,where the player smashes the ants as fast as possible . 

In the far far far future where Aliens discovers earth they decide they want to seizing it by destroying it through shooting meteors at it ,so in our game the player will try to protect the earth as much as possible . 

Now into the details of the game ( Saving Terra ) which is an attack of meteors and rockets by the aliens , the player will try to smash them that are trying to attack the earth to protect it , by clicking at the flying meteors and rockets as fast as they can , at first the speed of the flying meteors and rockets will be slow and then it'll increase as it gets harder to smash them all. 

One of the potential problems that we think we may face is how to determine the speed of the meteors and rockets, and we thought about making the players unlock the level by completing the previous one but we thought it'll be complicated so we still confused whether we can do it or not. 

We didn't use any references just our ideas and our inspirations of some famous games .
